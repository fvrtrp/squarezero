Don't you agree that you need to fully understand your potential, dark or not.....but actually, especially your dark, bad bad side to know what's possible?
Forget understanding, you'll have to experience that side of you, you'll have to live through days, weeks, months, or even years in a single state of mind, a pure one track mind, fully inebriated, no other distractions and that-
That'll be depravity
Yes exactly! I think there's something, actually many things, latent things...invaluable things we'll figure out by means of depravity.
You've lost your mind in that case, fellow classmate.
No...You sir, aren't getting my point.
I completely get it. I'm saying that's a road I'd rather not take.
I'm not asking you to actually do it, im asking you out on another mental venture.
Nah man gods, ghosts, supernatural shit, getting fucked up, ufos and conspiracies are where I draw the line. I don't want to waste time.
After a long pause, Peace says
"Too bad then"

There are exceptionally few events in your life where you meet a person, and it all clicks; it's then that chances you take can completely alter the course of your life in unprecedented ways. Kay's road with Peace ended there.
But there was another person in the classroom a few weeks later that, by either pure chance, or curiosity, or something he saw in Peace, made the choice to sit with him beyond a casual chat after a mutual friend introduced them during a Physics lecture.
Cook and Peace hit it off instantly. They knew they found their match by the end of the class. Cook was able to understand Peace's frequency; and he shared a reality with Peace that only the 2 of them could decipher.
Kay had a passive interest in what they were getting upto in college, but he was too busy with his own life.
Now, after all these years, he was horrified to learn what transpired at his university after he left.
.
.
Kay was thinking long and hard. He was baffled.
Apparently Cook and Peace made a last minute decision to stay at the University after graduation, starting a self-supervised PhD course somehow. They stayed there for 3 more years, before getting expelled.

**"You will not believe the things I will tell you, but they're all true"** said Gautham, this senior who looked absolutely hysterical.
Kay could take any clue to this case he was investigating. So he listened to it all.
"I have talked to people. Many people. My cousin Lalith studied with you, and he was the one who told me about this. Cook and Peace were not the same people a month after they met each other. They lost their minds on some drug. I'm telling you. People have seen shit. They've talked to me. They're dangerous to society. You have to find them."
.
After a few drinks with Lalith and Gautham
.
"Now, you tell me everything you know. Don't skip a detail. I'm not like the others, I will not judge you."
He got Lalith's trust.
"As Cook and Peace got closer, they gradually moved to the last bench. I think you know that."
"Right."
"They stopped listening to classes, and started doing their own shit. Teachers were fed up with their nonsense, but ignored them as they could answer any question, and obviously they did well in the tests.
Gautham intervened "They barricaded off their last bench and started sleeping there, too. Weird books, weird sketches, weird writings everywhere."
Lalith said "They were still friendly with us and all, but just weird."
"Really weird" said Gautham.
"Really weird", Lalith concurred.
"They needed money to move out of the hostel. So they started doing illegal shit. Started stealing, started scamming people, started selling pirated stuff, adult stuff etc"
"They bought a laptop and it funded itself. They started doing hacking on the internet. I saw dark web for the first time on his laptop."
Gautham said "They started doing drugs. Heavy drugs. First booze and pot, then hard drugs. People have told me that they've seen it."
"Things got even more out of hand when they moved into a big private house, far out of town. It was shady as hell. It always smelled like smoke. They had more computers and some electronic devices I think. They even made weird projects for our semester.
Then they just...gave up. They locked themselves in for days at a time, then weeks. We rarely saw them, usually in the football field at midnights, gorging on food like ravens. They looked unrecognizable, all disheveled and sleepless."
They were caught by the police multiple times for loitering in the forests. They were into some weird meditation yoga shit, but like some other dark thing."
"Surely people started making up things at one point right?" Kay intervened.
Lalith added, "Ignore the extreme claims, but I can just tell you that they were off. **After a year...they just looked possessed.**"

Gautham said, "A few months later a worker smelled weird things by an abandoned hostel room, and decided to check it out.
They burst the door open to find.....to find a room lit red, like an operation room...with a table and surgical knives and shit.
They were both wearing masks and coveralls, covered in blood...blood was splashing from the thing on the table, man...He was holding a butcher knife and chopping away at the thing. The other was standing next to him holding another chopping knife. He could only see their eyes, they were blood red, fully red, he told us vividly after running back in terror to the management. He peed his pants dude."
"What were they chopping?"
"That's what, it was an animal dude, a big animal, or a human..a fucking human" Gautham had tears in his eyes.

"Shut up"
"We couldn't prove it, the guy started weeping and blabbering nonsense. But when all of us, all the students, hundreds of us rallied there, nothing was there. They cleaned up."
"You were there?"
"No, a senior told us this. This happened 3 years ago.
When questioned, Peace said that the guy got high with them and started losing his shit over nothing. We had no reason to get angry, and we started questioning ourselves."
"Maybe that's all that is" Kay said.
"But there's one more strange thing that's weirder. So the very next day, Cook snitched on Peace to the Dean in private.
The Dean expelled Peace. 
Cook left the university too, abandoned his 'research' midway. He got a 9 to 5 at an IT firm. And that's all we know.


Kay couldn't believe anything he was told. He needed time to process it. But he knew that he was onto something.
