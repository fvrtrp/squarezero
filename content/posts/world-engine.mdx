The tug of these strings feels so real
Am I dreaming? this is so surreal
Mind of a robot, heart of gold, what don't you see?
The music keeps the night going
let it blow over, let it wash the feelings away
evolution is just a generation away
tombs and sticks and rocks and sand
none of this really matters, none of this lasts.
what are you expecting? there's only banality
platitudes and maxims are the commonality.
sleep through the slumber and forget the present.
there's a new world on the horizon, you just gotta listen.
the machine starts at dawn, you gotta be there.
the tricks of the last gen aren't funny or fair.
But there's a silver lining, there's some solace.
you were once part of a magic that ran the world engine.
