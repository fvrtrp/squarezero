My heart craves you and my mind too
I'll live through the days of solitude thinking about you
A picture of you is all it takes to go back in time
All the fun and games we had!
All the plays and wicked teases
Time flew by but we stayed in bed
Looking into each others' eyes and more
Your warm embrace and your happy face
Always stopping to catch me lost in the moment
We zipped through miles and highways, never getting bored
It does not matter how far you are, my mind is with you
A whiff of my shirt you wore makes me miss you
My head goes gaga when I think about you

I'll make a few promises to remember you by.
I will always be happy and full of life.
I will love life, and I will live free.
I promise to work hard towards what keeps me excited.
I will always live in the moment, and take it all in.
I'll always stay weird and crazy.
I promise to always keep it new and different.
I will always stretch the horizons and break boundaries.
I promise to keep my mind racing and my heart stoked.
I will aspire to live like you
But most of all i promise to keep you in my thoughts and always miss you

I hope your soul continues to teem with life and joy
And you continue driving me to awe
