Let's make a fucking deal.A giant fucking deal.
Ten years from now,I'm gonna own a fucking huge home.Like a really biiiig one.The house that everyone else's gonna envy,desire.The one that makes people fucking jealous.The one that's the ultimate house that one can ever dream of.The home,which looks and feels plush,makes people go nuts.
A house made of and having really fucking amazing things.Made of the best things ever used to make a house.A house with jaw-dropping aesthetic appeal,surreal interiors.The one that feels so spacious and luxurious that you'll think you're in a fucking seven star hotel.
Okay,then.The deal's sealed.Note the date,it's
The Twenty Fifth of July , 2014.  That is, 25-07-2014.
By The Twenty Fifth of July,2024 ,that is 25-07-2024, the deal will be fucking fulfilled.
How it's gonna look :
It'll at least be a four storey building.
The outdoors :
In the space before the house,a big porch,and then lawn.
On the side,a swing and space to just walk around,or sit and talk.
On the back,space for a badass garage,with a fucking amazing car.
And a super fast bike too.
There'll be two entrances side by side,one enough to fit a four wheeler,and the other enough to fit a person.
For the walk-in entrance , a frame made of some materials will be surrounding them,and a carpet on the surface.The lawn will be on the left,and the four wheeler entrance on the right.This walk-in entrance will lead to the porch.The compound and the porch will be lit by super luxurious lamps.Even the walls will be lit by lamps from the inside.
The indoor views :
The fourth and the top most floor will be mine.
It'll have a big and bad ass living room.
A huge TV,home theater,gaming console and all and sickly soft sofas to sit.
The ground floor will be for the guests  and will also serve as the common living room.The first floor'll be for my parents.The second one for relatives, or guests who crash at our house.
The first,second and third will have huge balconies.The third floor will also serve as a gorgeous party floor,preferably with a pool too.
All right,i'll start prepping for this vision of mine to come true.
Let's fucking go !
