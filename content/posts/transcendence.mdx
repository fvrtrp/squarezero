There's a flower at the top of the mountain
I fly and leap and sprint
Planes slide and shift
Reality oscillates playfully
Tantalizing my spirit

I reach the clouds
And descend into the lavender fields
As the morning fog touches my skin
I'm ecstatic as I run through the greens
Sun rises and cools down
Moon is vanilla in taste and crisp

Desert sands are dancing 
Waves splash down on the rocks and turn into mist
Milky way lights up the sky
As comets dash across the zenith 
The world is a box that fits in my palm
I shuffle it around and dance 

Flashes of the past, and glimpses of the future 
I'm everywhere at once
Permeating and fusing into. 
Ethereal magic
Sparks of milk and drops of diamond
It's rather white and pure
For a heart of darkness
