I wish time would just pass
Cuz I wouldn't last
Even a day without my vices
Been inebriated for ages
My mind's stuck on the past
Not a chance of getting back
If I don't stay sober,
All the games are over
Now it's time to take a chance
And run the last of the mazes
It's time to be courageous
And take a stride
Of action, so much inaction
My brain's gonna blast
I've nothing to do and no one to meet
All my friends, they're in the past
I got no purpose, I got no ambition
Can I just skip to the last
Part of me wants to be in the moment
And make most of it while I can
But goddamn time is so fuckin' elastic
But the present is everlasting, it's so plastic
