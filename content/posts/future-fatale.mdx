Freckles and fairies
farms and the farthest galaxies
the browns in your eyes and the brightest stars
I detest the dichotomy
I desist from all my machinations
I've gone through with it too far
time is so annoyingly linear
stars and songs, they keep me occupied
solos and the sun, I get by life.
there will be a day of amnesia
the perfectly imperfect clarity
of thought and memories
where you don't exist and I don't dream
radiation will be poison and biology ignoble.
the typewriter will be stashed, the papers burnt
hey, you can't be bothered if your mind is lost.
