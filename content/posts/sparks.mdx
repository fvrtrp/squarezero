# Status Update
First, for the bad news. I have relapsed again. It was bad; I wasted a full day on addictions and autopilot.
I caved in and yielded to the withdrawal. I realised what was happening, and yet chose to let go of control.
I feel bad for that, and I think I'm better than that.
That being said, *the good news:*
The past few days have been excellent! Not any normal good, but excellent!
I have been extremely productive, like never before, atleast the past few years.

# On top of things
My mind was racing, I was on top of things, and I had full control. No autopilot.
I resisted urges, I showed restraint, and I fought demons.
Looking back, it feels great that I was able to do that.
In fact, it gives me a kick thinking about that, and I cannot wait to do it all over again,
this time with a stronger punch. I was talking about trying to rekindle some of the fire I once had.
I think I did just that.
I got a load of things done, and not just that.
I wasn't trying to do stuff to pass the days, but rather I was the maker of the plans,
and I was the executer. I had the big picture in mind, and I followed through with the actual work needed.
Work was great, learning was great, and I even started a little side project!
I think I can get addicted to being a strategist and an executioner; it's sweet.
The past 3-4 days have given me immense hope and strength to do this right.

# Looking ahead
It sucks that I relapsed by day 5, but this has taught me so much!
This time, I'm gonna go against the dragon with knowledge of the past, and a lot more fortitude, and perseverance.
I cannot wait to kickstart this again, and be awesome at it.
I cannot stop thinking about success, and the future.
I cannot wait to persist, execute strats, innovate, excel and disrupt.
