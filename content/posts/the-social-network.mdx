I was crashing there for a little bit while i was taking care of somethings,but she's done for the summer,so she's back at her parents' place.
The homeless rockstar of Palo Alto!
All right!
What's your plan for this summer?
(Mark stares at the strippers)
Mark?
Yea,i was looking at the architecture.
I asked what your plan for this summer is.
A hundred schools by the end of this summer.
We're gonna go to the restroom.
All right!
Your date looks so familiar to me.
She looks familiar to a lot of people.
What do you mean?
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond wanted to buy his wife some lingerie.But he was to shy to shop for it in a department store.Comes up with an idea for a high end place that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.
So he balls a forty thousand dollar bank loan,balls another forty thousand from his in-laws,opens a store,calls it "Victoria's Secret".Makes half a million dollars his first year.Starts a catalog,opens three more stores,and sells the company to Leslie Wexner and the limited for four million dollars.Happy ending,right?Except few years later,the company's worth Five Hundred million dollars,and Roy Raymond,jumps off the Golden Gate bridge....Poor guy,just wanted to buy his wife a pair of thigh-highs,you know?
Was that a parable?
My date's a Victoria's secret model,that's why she looks familiar to you.
Wow.
Don't be impressed.I saw your blog.
Ah,that was for web cretins.
You know why i founded Napster?
No.
The girl i loved in high school was with the co-captain of the Varsity Lacrosse team,and i wanted to take her from him.That's why i decided to come up with the next big thing.
Wow.
Napster wasn't a failure,it changed the music industry for better and for always.It may not have been a good business,but it pissed a lot of people off.Isn't that what your Facemash was about?They're scared of me,pal and they're gonna be scared of you.What the VC's want is to say "Good idea,kid!The grown-ups will take it from here".But not this time!This is our time!This time,you're gonna a business card that says "I'm CEO,bitch!".That's what i want for you.So where the hell's Eduardo?
He's in New York.
Sucking up to ad execs.
He's got an internship.
The company's here.A billion dollar company's here.Eduardo wants to be a businessman,and for all i know,he's going to be a good one,but he shouldn't be in New York,kissing Madison Avenue's ass.This is a one in a lifetime 'HolyShit!' idea !And the water under the Golden Gate bridge is freezing cold.Look at my eyes and tell me i don't know what i'm talking about.
Do you still think about that girl?
What girl?
The girl from the high school,with the Lacrosse thing,
No!
If you guys are gonna talk about gambling,we need shots!
So a hundred schools by the end of this summer,right?
Yes.
Gesture of good faith,while you're getting to a hundred schools,i'm gonna put you on two continents.
Wow.
If you need a place to crash,i think you should definitely come and live with us.
Let's line up some shots!
Excuse me.you can take this away and bring back the 1942.
Absolutely,Mr. Parker.
