He unleashes wrath and torment
Destruction ensues his trail
He despises the witch who creates.

Benevolent and brave
Her stride invokes awe
As she fosters universes
Her kindness knows no bounds.

He looks into the void of fringe
Waiting is a fool’s game
Purpose is lost forever
His time never comes.

She longs to make a new enclave
Her fingertips wave and
spew the essence
As she blesses another
With chance and love. 

Aimless and forlorn
He finds the goddess
concocting yet another world
Turns to her with fire in the
eyes and soul.

She melts his fury,
and burns the void
She consoles and he
confides in her the future.
Instance of eons in clarity
All that’s needed is infinity.

Together they set out
Spreading life as we know 
Minds collide and mingle
As they fly and sparkle
Hoping for something divine.

Worlds everywhere set ablaze
Teeming with hope and power
Knowing they will get their
time to prosper.
