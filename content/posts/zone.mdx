O'Great power, what do I do?
I get so overwhelmed, I don't know what to do
There are thoughts that set my mind ablaze
All the things I could achieve
But none too simple to undertake
I long to fly far away and purely meditate
Grasping the truth; as simple as it is
I long to indulge in the purest tones of debauchery
Seeking and devouring, till the carnality cloys
But O' Great power, how can I spare time?

O' Great power, I get caught up
I'm lost in the whims,
How can I fly when
The trappings of life have me grounded
And the constructs get me trapped
I'm a fool, for I fall for them everytime
I feel like it's all coming together
Just before my vision falls apart
And my little mind loses sanity
O' Great power, do I always turn to you and pray?

O' Great power, life has left me jaded
How do I disregard the noise
The banality of it all gets me nauseated
How do I thwart the reality that encompasses
Maybe I just need to concentrate enough
And wait for the eventual epiphany
That O' Great power, I do know how
To get through the tough times

I get in the zone, I can see the blank
Reality has faded and made way for the ineffable
I feel weightless, like the light itself
Time dilutes and my vision sharpens,
My senses ditch the universe and probe inside me
I feel nothing but my thoughts
When I witness my unbridled power
My state of mind and its course clear as water
O' Great power, what have you done?

Have you infiltrated my soul?
Or were you always present?
