I scan another planet and scour another star.
my prescience told me something once precious was once lost
in the wilderness of the civilization
the only place to look now is beyond the boundaries
I'm the best in finding peculiarities and patterns
yet I pitter patter in vain around another saturn
flashes of the future show amusement
that morphs into the biggest disappointment
What can it be, how could I forget?
the wise man on the star told me I hadn't looked everywhere
I had an epiphany and I saw the future.
it was an entire epoch of menace and torture.
and then the deja vu hit me
for it had happened again in a thousand years
I listened to the song that I saved for this moment
and it took me away, way into the future
life is good and the stars are fine
I'm a stellar detective, so good at finding the lost
I scan another planet and scour another star.
