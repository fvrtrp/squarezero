No more surprises
in fantasy, I can clearly see
This is really me
Breaking the tide
Of hide and seek, let me surmise my destiny
Looking out the window, and I cannot see
My visions, have faded in obscurity
And I try to sleep
But these fuckin' demons keep haunting me
Flashes of the past, they give me the chills
When it's time to roll, I just slip and slide
As I flounder through the day, there's no other way
Guess that's my way
Of life, time's slipping away
I cannot sleep, I cannot pray
What's left is a phantom
Life's gone away through the window
As I gaze
