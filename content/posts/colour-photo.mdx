# Aftertaste
For some movies, the ending is a hard slap on the face.
You are not ready for what you are going to witness.
You are shell-shocked; you are hit by a truck, metaphorically.
You might not even process the implications of the ending the next few days or weeks.
Sometimes, you don't even understand it and you move on.
But when you look back at the story, and if you do process it, boy you are in for a ride.
And in this case, it's a world of hurt and despair.
There's a lot of frustration and a feeling of injustice; blood seethes, eyes even well up as I keep thinking back to Colour Photo.
It's just not right for what happens at the end of the movie.
I'm broken, and I wanna rage. It's truly heart breaking.
A beautiful relationship, and a life with impending success and happiness are killed. Killed dispassionately.
And there is no happy ending. There is no optimism, except in the dishonest story the survivor chooses to tell strangers.
It has been two days, and I've only now begun processing that ending, and how brutal it was.
*This is what happens in the movie:*
A very poor/hard working/principled/virtuous guy falls in love with a girl from his college, and the feeling is mutual; and for this, first his leg is permanently broken and he is left handicapped, he is fed his cattle, he is beaten up and threatened. He then proceeds to drink poison and die. His family does not even have a photo of him; so they remember him by hanging his shirt in their hut.
His best friend is beaten up/so traumatized that he turns insane for life, and he is admitted to a mental asylum.
I just can't fathom this turn of events, and the impact of the movie lies in its aftertaste, not necessarily its runtime.

# Ideas over execution
One thing I have always observed, and often appreciated in movies is having the heart at the right place,
and the central ideas even when most of the times they are not reflected in the actual movie.
Though Colour Photo was rather well done, especially the cinematography, it's the core idea of the story that has left a scar in my mind.
Of course, the acting by Suhas and Chandini was impeccable, headlined by how she reacts when she sees his shirt hanging in the hut.
The teen comedy and some songs I could've lived without, but again, it's the ideas that remain in your head after you finish watching the movie.

# The ending
As I said before, I was not ready for that ending. I knew things did not turn out well, and there was tragedy looming,
I watched the fabricated ending unfold, and fell for it.
We are later shown what actually happens, in the same setting, and at the same time of day.
But instead of pulling off a heroic strat, the protagonist is bruised and beaten; he needs crutches to walk.
His life is done with; he knows it and talks about ending it all with his love.
They decide to consume poison at their hangout spot - the beach; they do,
but she is rescued just in time by her cousin while the poor guy lays there as his soul leaves his body,
helpless, and no one to check for him.
We see her in the present wailing over his shirt, and the movie cuts to 'Directed by Sandeep' rather non-chalantly, and the credits roll.
We are shown there is no help, and there is no guardian angel. There is no god or a force of good that causes miracles.
Tragedy ensues and life moves on. It can't get more real and grim.
