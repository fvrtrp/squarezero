Drifting through space,
all I see is a familiar face.
Why does the fire rekindle?
with heartbreaks and heartaches I stumble
into a belt of chaos
entropy is not my friend.
I'd rather just sit down and let it pass
deep within I know these things will last
forever, so I get up and I fumble
Inside my mind, it's all a jumble.
struggle and persist
I'm so lonely, I barely exist.
what was I made for, why am I here?
is it to get with her and make it real?
tricks of the mind, they feel so real
It's only when it's over that you heal
It's not even about me, I know
she's disillusioned and petty, and pretty stupid.
I'm so cocky but the truth hit me hard
Forget being the protagonist, I even lost the plot.
