Forgotten pasts, forgotten times.
Sometimes it's a tune, sometimes it's a fragrance, sometimes it's the cold rain.
Sometimes it's someone who has been there, and emerged victorious.
They bring a rush of guilt, a pinch of Nostalgia.
Sometimes happiness, a lot of times regret of what it could've been.
I try to ignore, but keeps hitting me over and
over till I acknowledge it.
Maybe asking me where I've been, what I've been doing.
Questioning why I abandoned it and absconded.
Maybe it wants me to get back there and finish what I started.
Maybe I need to forget all of this and bury it deep within my conscience.
Maybe I cowered and yielded at the wrong time.
Maybe I was too naive to see the reality, and face my demons.

Whatever the case, the phantom memories still incessantly haunt me, and I just can't seem to get over it.

What I can do, is write about it, hoping it alleviates some of the pain, and move on.
